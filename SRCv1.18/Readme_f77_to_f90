Hi Sergio,

I guess the best way to make the changes is to search for several things in the code. These are:

STRUCTURE
RECORD

These both need to be changed to type. You can find the formatting for TYPE in any of the new fortran
90 code. The STRUCTURE only appears in rtp/include/rtpdefs.f

So the format for STRUCTURE is (from an example for RTPHEAD)

STRUCTURE / RTPHEAD/

..... lines of code that won't change


END STRUCTURE

This becomes:

TYPE RTPHEAD   ! notice that the /  is gone

.... same lines of code


END STRUCTURE


Then you need to find the RECORD statements in Src:


RECORD / RTPHEAD / PROF

becomes

TYPE(RTPHEAD) PROF

Then you need to find anywhere that you see the structures used to define a variable, such as:


HEAD.vchan(I) = FREQ(I)

and change it to

HEAD%vchan(I) = FREQ(I)


and that is most of it. I don't have a record of exactly where it was done, but you can compare the files
in /home/tangborn/git/sarta/Src_rtpV201_pclsam_slabcloud_hg3

with those in /home/tangborn/git/sarta/Src_cloudy_old

using xxidff  and see the differences. Also have a look in

/home/tangborn/git/rtp/include and /home/tangborn/git/rtp/original_include to see
the differences there.

But I will be at UMBC tomorrow and can explain more.
