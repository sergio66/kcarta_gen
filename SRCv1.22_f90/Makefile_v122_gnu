# makefile to build kcarta.x
# >>>>>>>>  make basic >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> is the easiest one!!
#
# "make" or "make scat" will compile kcarta.x and move it to
# its home in the ../BIN directory
# 
# "make kcarta.x" will compile kcarta.x and leave it in the current
# directory
#
# Example compiler flags and libraries are included for several
# compilers and architectures.  Initial testing should be done with
# array checking on; When things are working OK, you can leave out
# the array checking and crank up the optimization.

# Things to do before typing "Make"
# Remember all .param and include files are in ../INCLUDE (kcarta.param, 
#    scatter.param, pre_defined.param, gauss.param) while for rtpdefs.f, we 
#    have a Makefile directive for the include file (see RTP section below)

# see Readme_MakefileCommentsA

## NOTE 1) only SGI F77 and Absoft have been tested with the autodoubling ##
##         required by DISORT                                             ##
##      2) g77 does not support Fortan structures, so it cannot be used   ##
##         when compiling the RTP related code                            ##
##      3) If you ignore the above two limitations, and can figure out if ##
##         your compiler supports autodoubling and F77 structures, then   ##
##         we have a set of options for SunOS and SUN Solaris F77         ##
