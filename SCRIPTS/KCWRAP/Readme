the main source for this is Howard Motteler

main code is called "kcwrap," saved on /home/motteler/radtrans/kcwrap/kcwrap
this script allows user to do one kcarta run, from an input RTP file that 
can have more than one profile
       kcwrap [-s sfile] [-n pnum] infile outfile

howard has also written couple of other wrappers for this
 kcwrap2 can call kcwrap, for profiles n1 thru n2
        kcwrap2 [-s sfile] [-n1 pnum] [-n2 pnum] infile outfile

while "kcdemo1" is a wrapper that shares multiple profiles in the same RTP 
files across multiple processors. does not seem to work, so use kcdemo0
