Currently you will find the (nonscattering) version of kCARTAv1.10 on the web.
Do an anonymous ftp to asl.umbc.edu (or use the web) :
   database is at /kcarta/data    (both big endian and little endian)
   source code is at /packages
     kcartagiveout110.tar.gz : nonscattering source code
     kcartaDATA.tar.gz       : has some extra data files that are useful
     kcartaMATLAB.tar.gz     : some Matlab code (readers for kCARTA output)
Extra source code you need is also at /packages
    klayersV204.tar.gz       : takes levels data, and changes it to "layers"
    rtpV105.tar.gz           : the data files in/out of klayers and kCARTA
                               are in this hdf format

This version has been debugged and tested by quite a few people, and a variety
of users around the world, using various flavors of Unix and Fortran 
compilers. It's not guaranteed to be 100% bug free, but most probably, if you 
don't understand the output from kCARTA, it is because it did exactly what 
you commanded (i.e. read the user manual beforehand!!!). This applied 
equally to the KLAYERS and RTP packages!

I am usually available to answer questions!
