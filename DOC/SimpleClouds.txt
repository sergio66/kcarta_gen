We are implementing a "zero scattering" algorithm to include the effects of 
clouds in the atmosphere. This algorithm ignores the phase scattering 
information (related to the asymmetry paramater "g"), and cannot
be used in the presence of a solar beam. It works best in regions where the
single scattering albedo and asymmetry factor are close to 0. Another point 
to note is that we supply the Mie scattering tables for clouds made of ice 
particles whose average diameter ranges from from 0.1 to 100 um in size; 
water clouds would have similar overall properties, but would have lower 
extinction optical depths. 

The simplicity  of the model means that its results are only applicable for 
(ice) cirrus clouds in the 8-10 um region, as the single scattering albedo 
and the asymmetry parameter are close to zero in that region. For ice paths 
of upto 10 g/m2, this model produces errors of less than about 1 K (when 
compared to DISORT or RTSPEC) in the 8-10 um region. For similar cirrus 
clouds in the 3.5 um region, this same model can produce errors of about 15 K.
