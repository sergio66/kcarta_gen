    Abstract

We present a data format for driving radiative transfer calculations and
manipulating atmospheric profiles. Calculated and observed radiances may
be included as optional fields, allowing for the representation of basic
co-location datasets. An implementation as HDF 4 Vdatas is given,
including Fortran, C, and Matlab application interfaces.


    1  Introduction

The ``Radiative Transfer Profile'' (RTP) format is a data format for
sets of atmospheric profiles, optionally paired with calculated and/or
observed radiances. The format consists of a header record and an array
of profile records. It was derived from the GENLN2 user profile format,
extened with selected AIRS level 2 field definitions. RTP is currently
implemented as HDF 4 Vdatas and as structure arrays in Fortran, C, and
Matlab.

The format is intended to give a well-defined interface to radiative
transfer codes, allowing for the specification of just the information
needed for such calculations. It allow for modularity of both radiative
transfer codes and of other tools for manipulating profiles, including
tools for field selection, level interpolation and level-to-layer
translations, translation of units, and building composite profiles from
multiple sources. The RTP specification has some flexibility in the
field set actually saved to disk, both to save space and to provide
compatibility across file versions. The optional observation fields may
be used to build simple co-location datasets.


    2  The RTP format definition

The RTP format consists of a header record with information about all
the profiles in a file, and one or more profiles saved as an array of
records. Field definitions for the header and profile records are given
below. These names are both the names of the Vdata fields and the
Fortran, C, and Matlab structure fields, with the exception of the
constituent arrays, as discussed below. Depending on the application,
only a subset of the fields described here need be present in an RTP
file. Fields are matched by field name, and no particular order for the
header or profile fields is assumed.

Notes:

 [1] ptype values are
        1. level profile       LEVPRO = 0
        2. layer profile       LAYPRO = 1
        3. AIRS pseudo-layers  AIRSLAY = 2

 [2] RTP profile fields are organized in five groups
        1. profile data              PROFBIT = 1
        2. calculated IR radiances   IRCALCBIT = 2
        3. observed IR radiances     IROBSVBIT = 4
        4. calculated MW Tb          MWCALCBIT = 8
        5. observed MW Tb            MWOBSVBIT = 16
     For example, a profile with both calculated and observed IR
     radiances would have pfields = PROFBIT + IRCALCBIT + IROBSVBIT

      2.1  Levels and Layers

For level profiles, nlevs is the number of levels and plevs the pressure
levels; the nlevs temperature and constituent fields contain level
values. For layer profiles, nlevs is the number of layer boundaries,
plevs is the boundary pressures, and the nlevs - 1 temperature and
constituent fields contain layer values. The optional plays field may be
used for a nominal layer pressure, if desired. The palts field, if used,
is altitudes for the pressure levels, for either level or layer profiles.

The header field ptype flags the profile as being a level profile, a
layer profile, or a profile using AIRS pseudo-layers, with the following
values.

    1. level profile        LEVPRO = 0
    2. layer profile        LAYPRO = 1
    3. AIRS pseudo-layers   AIRSLAY = 2

A convention that lower indices correspond to lower pressures is
suggested but not required. The header fields pmax and pmin are intended
to hold the max and min level pressures over all profiles, or some upper
and lower bound on these values.


      2.2  Constituents

Constituent fields are named with their HITRAN gas ID's, with gas_1
water, gas_2 CO_2 , and so on. A list of HITRAN gas ID's is given in an
appendix. The header field glist gives a list of the constituent ID's
for the constituents present in the file. The default constituent unit
is PPMV.

The Fortran and C application interfaces represent constituents as a 2D
array gamnt whose rows are layers and whose columns are gas ID index,
rather than as a set of separate fields gas_<i> as they are actually
saved in the file; the gas_<i> fields are the columns of the 2D gamnt
array.

There are a wide variety of constituent units in current use; in
consideration of this we have added a gunit array to the header,
assigning a unit code for each constituent and allowing at least the
potential for automatic conversions. These unit codes are given in
gas_units_code.txt. This file is included in the RTP distribution, but
the most up-to-date version can be found in the SARTA fast radiative
transfer package.

Note that only a small subset of possible constituents are typically
recognized and processed by fast models for radiative transfer
calculation, typically water, ozone, and perhaps methane, CO_2 , and CO;
see the documentation of the relevant radiative transfer code for more
information.


      2.3  Field Sets and Sizes

Individual profiles may have varying pressures levels, emissivity,
reflectance, and surface brightness temperature sets. All profiles in a
file are assumed to have the same constituent set, and if radiances are
present all profiles have the same channel set.

RTP fields may be scalars or one-dimensional arrays; this is a
limitation of the underlying HDF Vdata format. Most arrays have an
associated size field. If this size field is in the header, as in the
case of ngas or nchan then it is assumed to be the same for all
profiles, while if the size field is in a profile, as in the case of
nlevs or nemis, then it applies only to that profile.

The size of array fields in the RTP HDF Vdata implementation may in some
cases be bigger than what is specified by the associated size field.
This can happen because the HDF Vdata format requires a single size be
associated with each field, which then has to be at least the max of all
the actual field sizes. Because of this, when a size-field is avaliable
its value should be used instead of the possibly larger Vdata field size.

The field set for RTP is not required to be fixed to precisely the
fields listed here. Fields are matched by field name, and no particular
order for the header or profile fields is assumed


      2.4  Field Groups

The pfields field in the header is used by the C/Fortran API to control
what which field groups will be written to a file. Profile fields are
organized as five groups,

   1. profile data                      PROFBIT = 1
   2. calculated IR radiances           IRCALCBIT = 2
   3. observed IR radiances             IROBSVBIT = 4
   4. calculated MW brightness temp.    MWCALCBIT = 8
   5. observed MW brightness temp.      MWOBSVBIT = 16

These groups can occur in any combination. The associated numbers are
bit fields, set in pfields if the associated data is present in the
file. Thus for example profile data with calculated and observed IR
radiances would be represented as pfields  = PROFBIT + IRCALCBIT +
IROBSVBIT, while a profile with calculated and observed MW radiances but
no IR data would have pfields  = PROFBIT + MWCALCBIT + MWOBSVBIT.

Note that we can have nchan > 0 and channel data in the header without
having either calculated or observed radiances in a file, to specify a
set of channels whose radiances are to be calculated later.


      2.5  HDF Attributes

Attributes are associated either with the header or with the profile
record set, and have three parts: the field the attribute is associated
with, the attribute name, and the attribute text. In addition to proper
field names, the field name ``header'' is used for general header
attributes, and ``profile'' for general profile attributes.

RTP attributes should typically include such information as title,
author, date, and at least a brief descriptive comment. This general
information should be set as attributes of the header record. Note that
the Fortran/C API uses the 2D gamnt array for constituents; this is not
actually a Vdata field, and so can not take an attribute. Attributes may
be attached to individual constituents with their gas_<i> names, where
<i> is the HITRAN gas ID.


    3  Application Interfaces


      3.1  The Fortran and C API

The Fortran API consists of four routines: rtpopen, rtpread, rtpwrite,
and rtpclose. Documentation for these is included in an appendix. The
Fortran API uses static structures whose fields, with a few exceptions
noted below, are the same as the RTP fields defined above. Normally,
only a subset of the Fortran structure fields will be written, with the
header field pfields and the header size fields used to determine what
actually goes into a file. When reading data, if a file contains header
or profile fields not in the Fortran structure definition, they are
simply ignored. Fields that are defined in the Fortran structure but are
not in a file are returned as ``BAD'', or with the first element BAD,
for vectors, while missing size fields are returned as zero.

Attributes are passed to and from the Fortran API in the RTPATTR
structure array. The records in this array have three fields: fname, the
field name the attribute is to be associated with, aname, the attribute
name, and atext, the attribute text. The header attribute field name
should be either ``header'', for a general attribute or comment, or a
particular header field name. Similarly, the attribute profile field
name should be either ``profiles'' or a specific profile field.
Attribute strings need to be null-terminated, with char(0), and the
record after the last valid record in an attribute set should have fname
set to char(0). See ftest1.f for and ftest2.f examples of reading,
writing, and updating attributes.

The Fortran structures differer from the Vdata fields in two ways.
First, instead of a gas_<i> profile field for each constituent, the
Fortran API uses a single array gamnt(MAXLEV,MAXGAS) to pass constituent
amounts; the gas_<i> fields from the HDF file are the columns of this
array. Second, the Fortran/C RTP header structure includes the following
max size fields, which are not actually written to the Vdata header.

 mlevs     max number of levels   scalar int32   [0,MAXLEV]
 mrho      max num of refl pts    scalar int32   [0,MAXRHO]
 memis     max num of emis pts    scalar int32   [0,MAXEMIS]
 mwmemis   max MW emis pts        scalar int32   [0,MWMAXEMIS]
 mwmstb    max MW sTb pts         scalar int32   [0,MWMAXSTB]

On a read, these fields are set to the associated profile Vdata field
sizes. On a write, they are used to to set the size of the associated
Vdata profile fields. They can simply be set to the MAX limits, or to
zero if the fields are not used; but using an actual max for the profile
set, particularly for mlevs, can give a significant space savings.

A makefile is supplied to build the RTP API routines as a library file
librtp.a. A Fortran demo makefile, ``Makefile.f77'' is also provided, to
compile the F77 demo programs ftest1.f and ftest2.f and link them with
the RTP libraries.


      3.2  The Matlab API

The RTP Matlab implementation is a fairly direct mapping between Matlab
structure arrays and HDF 4 Vdatas. A read will only return those fields
that are in the HDF Vdata, and a write will only write the fields in the
Matlab structure. The Matlab RTP API is available as part of the ASL
package ``h4tools''; see the README file there for more information.


      3.3  Data Types

Most RPT fields are either 32-bit integers or 32-bit floats, as noted in
the field tables, with the exception of the time fields which are 64-bit
floats, and the pnote and calflag fields, which are character arrays.
The HDF C types are defined in the HDF include file ``hdf.h''.

   HDF type codes     HDF C types      Fortran types
    DFNT_INT32          int32           integer*4
    DFNT_FLOAT32        float32         real*4

NAME

  rtpopen -- Fortran interface to open RTP files

SUMMARY

  rtpopen() is used to open an HDF RTP ("Radiative Transfer Profile")
  file for reading or writing profile data.  In addition, it reads or
  writes RTP header data and HDF header and profile attributes. 

FORTRAN PARAMETERS

  data type             name      short description       direction
  ---------             -----     -----------------       ---------
  CHARACTER *(*)        fname     RTP file name              IN
  CHARACTER *(*)        mode      'c'=create, 'r'=read       IN
  STRUCTURE /RTPHEAD/   head      RTP header structure       IN/OUT
  STRUCTURE /RTPATTR/   hfatt     RTP header attributes      IN/OUT
  STRUCTURE /RTPATTR/   pfatt     RTP profile attributes     IN/OUT
  INTEGER               rchan     RTP profile channel        OUT

VALUE RETURNED

  0 if successful, -1 on errors

INCLUDE FILES

  rtpdefs.f -- Fortran header, profile, and attribute structures

DISCUSSION

  The valid open modes are 'r' to read an existing file and 'c' to
  create a new file.

  HDF attributes are read and written in an array of RTPATTR
  structures, with one structure record per attribute.  Attributes
  should be terminated with char(0), and are returned that way, for
  a read.  The end of the attribute array is flagged with a char(0)
  at the beginning of the fname field.


NAME    

  rtpread -- Fortran interface to read an RTP profile

SUMMARY

  rtpread reads a profile from an open RTP channel, and returns
  the data in the RTPPROF structure.  Successive calls to rtpread
  return successive profiles from the file, with -1 returned on
  EOF.


FORTRAN PARAMETERS

  data type             name      short description       direction
  ---------             -----     -----------------       ---------
  INTEGER               rchan     RTP profile channel         IN
  STRUCTURE /RTPPROF/   prof      RTP profile structure       OUT

VALUE RETURNED

  1 (the number of profiles read) on success , -1 on errors or EOF


NAME    

  rtpwrite -- Fortran interface to write an RTP profile

SUMMARY

  rtpwrite writes an RTP profile, represented as the contents
  of an RTPPROF structure, to an open RTP channel.  Successive
  calls write successive profiles.

FORTRAN PARAMETERS

  data type             name      short description       direction
  ---------             -----     -----------------       ---------

  STRUCTURE /RTPPROF/   prof      RTP profile structure       IN

VALUE RETURNED

  0 on success, -1 on errors


NAME    

  rtpclose -- Fortran interface to close an RTP open channel

SUMMARY

  rtpclose finishes up after reading or writing an RTP file, 
  writing out any buffers and closing the HDF interface

FORTRAN PARAMETERS

  data type     name      short description      direction
  ---------     -----     -----------------      ---------
  INTEGER       rchan     RTP profile channel       IN

VALUE RETURNED

  0 on success, -1 on errors


NAME    

  rtpinit -- initialze RTP profile and header structures

SUMMARY

  rtpinit initializes RTP profile structures with some sensible
  default vaules, and is used when creating a new profile set; it
  should generally not be used when modifying existing profiles.

  rtpinit sets all field sizes to zero, and all data values to
  "BAD", so that only actual values and sizes need to be written

     -c      dump RTP channel info
     -h      dump header structure
     -p      dump profile structure
     -n <k>  select profile <k> for channel or profile 
             structure dumps; the first profile is 1
  
   BUGS

     the output is from debug and error dump routines and is not very
     fancy; the -p option only prints a subset of profile fields
