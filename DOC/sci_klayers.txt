Introduction:
------------

This file explains some of the physical/mathematical and practical 
considerations in the development of the kCARTA layers code.  The layers
program was originally written to support the development of a fast
transmittance model for the AIRS (Atmospheric Infra-Red Sounder) satellite
instrument.  The kCARTA layers are exactly the same as the AIRS layers.

The basic problem is to convert a profile supplied at arbitrary points in
the atmosphere and interpolate between the points to form slab-average
or slab-integrated values.  The creation of a layering code such as this
one is complicated by the interaction of many of the profile variables, as
well as the presumed variation of these across the layer. For example, a
layer defined as the region between two fixed pressure levels will not, in
general, have the same thickness for profiles with different values of
temperature and water mixing ratios.  This is because layer thickness is a
function of air density (which depends on temperature and mixing ratio) and
gravity (which depends primarily on altitude and latitude).  This directly
impacts the integrated layer absorber amounts.


The Hydrostatic Equation:
------------------------
The kCARTA layers program is based upon solving the hydrostatic equation.
The hydrostatic equation (which assumes negligible vertical acceleration
of the air) is used to relate pressure to altitude:

  dP(z)/dz = -g(z) * D(z)

  where:
     P = air pressure
     z = altitude above Earth's surface
     g = gravitational acceleration; a known expression (see note 2)
     D = air mass density = C(z) * P(z)/T(z), where C(z) is the mass of one
         mole of air divided by the gas constant R, and T(z) is the
         temperature. C varies only slightly with altitude and profile (see
         note 1).

   Note 1: The Molecular Mass of Air
   ---------------------------------
   The virial coefficients of air are small enough that for realistic Earth
   profiles air may be treated as an ideal gas. For example, the miniumum
   molar volume for an ideal gas is:

      Vmin = R * Tmin / Pmax
   
   Suppose Tmin = 200 K and Pmax 1100 mb. Then:

      Vmin = ( 8.314 (N.m)/(K.mol) * (100 cm/m) * 200 K ) /
         ( 1100 mb * 100 (N/m^2)/mb * (m/(100 cm))^2 )

      Vmin = 1.5E+4 cm^3/mol 

   From the "American Institute of Physics Handbook" (pg 4-169) the first
   order virial coefficient for air at 200K is Bv = -38.241 cm^3/mol, so
   for this worst-case example, R for air is:

      R_air = R_ideal * (1 + Bv/V)

      R_air = R_ideal * (1 - 38.241/1.5E+4) = 0.9975 * R_ideal

   Thus we can say that for realistic Earth profiles we should be able to
   treat R as a constant to within better than 0.25%.

   "Air" is a mixture of various gas molecules, and so the mass of one mole
   of air depends upon the masses of the different molecules making up the
   air as well as their mixing ratios. If the mixing ratios of the various
   atmospheric gases vary, so will the molecular mass of air. However, for
   altitudes in the atmosphere below about 100 km, the molecular mass of
   "dry air" (ie all elements except for water) stays nearly constant at
   28.97 grams per mole. Thus the variation in "air" molecular mass is due
   almost entirely to variations in the water mixing ratio.

   For example, an extremely wet profile might have a mixing ratio for water
   that goes as high as 10^5 ppmv (Parts Per Million, Volume) somewhere near
   the Earth's surface. Since water has a mass of 18.01 g/mol, then the air
   molecular mass in this case is:
      (1 - 10^5/10^6)*28.97 + (10^5/10^6)*18.01 = 27.87 g/mol
   which is about 4% less than dry air. Thus we must conclude that treating
   the molecular mass strictly as a constant may lead to errors of up to 4%
   for layers below, say, 10 km.

   Note 2: Gravity as a Function of Altitude
   -----------------------------------------
   Gravity as used here refers to the total downward acceleration acting on
   a body in the Earth's atmosphere. It consists not only of gravitational
   acceleration, but also the centripetal acceleration due to the Earth's
   rotation (and possibly wind as well). It may be expressed as:
      g(z) = g_surface - change_in_centripetal_acceleration(z) -
         change_in_gravitation(z).
   We make the approximations:
      change_in_centripetal_acceletaion(z) =V_surface^2/r - V_total^2/R
   and
      change_in_gravitation(z) = gravitation_at_surface*(1 - r^2/R^2)
   where r is the Earth's radius (as a function of latitude):
      r = sqrt( b^2/[ 1 - (1 - b^2/a^2)*cos^2(latitude) ] )
      with a = equatorial radius = 6.378388E+6 m,
      and b = polar radius = 6.356911E+6 m ,
   R is the total distance from the Earth's center:
      R = r + z
      where z is the altitude above the Earth's surface,
   V_surface^2 is the square of the speed of the Earth's surface:
      V_surface = 2*pi*r*f*cos(latitude), with f = 1/86400 rev/sec,
   V_total^2 is the square of the total speed of the air (parallel to the
      Earth's surface) due to the Earth's rotation and winds:
      V_total^2 = [2*pi*R*f*cos(latitude) + V_wind_east]^2 + V_wind_north^2
   and g_surface is the surface gravity given by:
      g_surface = 9.780455*[ 1 + 5.30157E-6*sin^2(latitude)
         - 5.85E-6*sin^2(2*latitude)
         + 6.40E-6*cos(latitude)*cos(2*[longitude + 18 degrees]) ] m/s^2
      (from "American Institute of Physics Handbook", 1963, pg 102).

   At the north pole (latitude = 90 degrees):
   For z = 0 km and no wind, g =  9.832307 m/s^2
   For z = 0 km and a wind of 30 m/s blowing south, g = 9.832166 m/s^2
   for z = 85 km and no wind, g = 9.574548 m/s^2
   For z = 85km and a wind of 90 m/s blowing south, g = 9.573291 m/s^2

   At the equator (latitude = 0 degrees, longitude = 0):
   For z = 0 km and no wind, g = 9.780505 m/s^2
   For z = 0 km and a wind of 30 m/s blowing south, g = 9.780364 m/s^2
   For z = 0 km and a wind of 30 m/s blowing east (in the same direction as
      the Earth's rotation), g = 9.776001 m/s^2
   For z = 85 km and no wind, g = 9.523619 m/s^2
   For z = 85 km and a wind of 90 m/s blowing south, g = 9.522366 m/s^2
   For z = 85 km and a wind of 90 m/s blowing east, g = 9.509275 m/s^2

   Thus we can see the effects of altitude are about 2.7%, while latitude
   is about 0.5% and winds are less than a 0.2% effect. This is at a level
   where the variation of gravity should be accounted for, but over small
   distances (a couple km or less) it can be treated as a constant.


An Approximation to the Hydrostatic Equation:
--------------------------------------------
Returning to the hydrostatic equation:

   dP(z)/dz = -g(z) * C(z) * P(z)/T(z)
 
we make the finite thin-slab approximations:

   dP = delta_P = (P2 - P1)
   dz = delta_z = (z2 - z1) = layer thickness
   g(z) = gavg
   P(z) = Pavg
   T(z) = Tavg
   C(z) = Cavg

and solve for layer thickness, getting:

   delta_z = - delta_P * Tavg / ( gavg * Cavg * Pavg )

Thus we need to somehow define Tavg, gavg, Cavg, and Pavg.

To calculate gavg, ideally we would like to use g(zavg). But since we do not
yet know the layer thickness, it is not obvious what zavg might be. However,
we do know that for thin layers (ie delta_z is small) that the difference

    g(z) - g(z + delta_z)

should be very small, and thus we may make he approximation:

    gavg = g(z_at_top_of_layer_below) 

Thus if we start out at a known ground height z0, and we work upward over the
layers, we can approximate gavg for all the layers. Note that we may use this
method to calculate delta_z for a layer and then say 

   zavg = z_top_of_layer_below +  delta_z/2

and then calculate gavg = g(zavg) and use this to re-calculate delta_z
before going on to the next layer. But it's probably not worth the extra
effort; the first approximation of zavg should be good enough.

To calculate Cavg, we might make the assumption that the air density would
make a good weighting factor for C and say:

   Cavg = (D1*C1 + D2*C2) / (D1 + D2) 

where D1 and D2 are the air densities:

   D = C * P / T

at the two layer boundaries.

The calculation of Tavg and Pavg should, in principle, somehow make use of
the gas mixing ratio. However, for our application (the Fast Transmittance
Code), we would like to have only one pressure and temperature that applies
to all gases, rather than one pressure and temperature for each gas. Thus
it might not be wise to make use of the mixing ratios when calculating Tavg
and Pavg.

For Tavg, we might treat it in a manner similar to Cavg and say:

   Tavg = (D1*T1 + D2*T2) / (D1 + D2)

For Pavg we need to be even more careful; we do not want any profile specific
dependence at all. Therefore we fall back on the crude approximation that:

    P = B*exp(A*z)

and so z varies as the ln(P). While this approximation is certainly very
crude if applied over the entire atmosphere, for our purposes we are only
applying it to thin layers.

Thus if we take the average of P with respect to z:

   Pavg = ( integral{z1 to z2}: P(z)*dz) / ( integral{z1 to z2}: dz )

The integrations are simple, giving:

   Pavg = ( (P2/A) - (P1/A) ) / (z2 - z1)

Since

   P = B*exp(A*z),  then  z = (1/A)*ln(P/B)

and so substituting for z1 and z2 gives:

   Pavg = (1/A) * (P2 - P1) / ( (1/A)*ln(P2/B) - (1/A)*ln(P1/B) )

   Pavg = (P2 - P1) / ( ln(P2/B) - ln (P1/B)

   Pavg = (P2 - P1)/ln(P2/P1)

Thus we have an equation for Pavg that depends only upon P and the implicit
assumption that z varies approximately as ln(P).


Layer Amounts:
-------------
A layer amount of the type required by kCARTA can be calculated using the
equation:

   A = den_ref * (Pavg/Tavg) * MRavg * delta_z

where
   den_ref = 1.2027E-12 (kmole/cm^2)*(K/mb)*(1/ppmv)*(1/m)
   Pavg, Tavg, and delta_z are as defined earlier, and
   MRavg = the average mixing ratio.

with MRavg perhaps being approximated by:

   MRavg = (D1*MR1 + D2*MR2)/(D1 + D2)

Here the mixing ratio MR refers to the fractional part (ppmv = Parts Per
Million, Volume) of the "air" consisting of a specific gas.  We should be
careful here to note that even if some gas has a fairly constant mixing ratio
with respect to "dry air", there will still be some variation in the "air"
mixing ratio due to the displacement of "dry air particles" by the molecules
of gases that do vary depending upon the profile.  Typically only water varies
enough to be worth noting.  Thus if a mixing ratio of any gas except water is
specified with respect to "dry air", its "wet air" mixing ratio should be
modified:

  Any gas except water:  MRwet = MRdry * (1 - MRwater/10^6)

where all mixing ratios are in ppmv.

In the case of water, the conversion is

  Water (only):    MRwet = 10^6 * MRdry/(MRdry + 10^6)

where again all mixing ratios are in ppmv.  Currently the layers program 
does *NOT* do a dry-to-wet mixing ratio conversion for water.  Therefore the
user needs to take care to always use a wet ppmv mixing ratio for water with
these programs.


Layers and Levels:
-----------------
As we use the terms, we mean different things when we speak of "layers" and
"levels".  A "level" refers to a point value, while a "layer" refers to a
finite thickness slab value.  We define our layers using levels as layer
boundaries. For AIRS, the definition is:

   Plev(i) = exp( (7/2) * ln( A*i^2 + B*i + C ) )

where
   i refers to the level number (an integer counter)
   and A, B, C are constants which obey the relation (exact):
      Plev(i=1)=1100, Plev(i=38)=300, Plev(i=101)=5.0E-3 mb
   with approximate values:
      A = -1.5508E-4
      B = -5.5937E-2
      C =  7.4516

These 101 level boundaries define the 100 AIRS layers; that is the AIRS layers
are the slabs between each adjacent pair of levels.

Typically, profile variables vary to some degree with altitude, so that in
general these variables vary between levels and across layers.  Since these
variables are usually considered to vary continuously with altitude, it is
necessary to make use of some relation that describes in what manner the
values vary between level data points.  This is necessary both to interpolate
the supplied data points onto the desired levels (if they are not supplied at
these levels), and to describe how the variables change across a layer.

Ideally, the profile data points should be supplied at a fine enough vertical
resolution such that any reasonable assumption about how things vary between
adjacent data points will give acceptibly accurate results. For example, we
make use of the following assumptions:

    Mixing ratios vary roughly as the logarithm of pressure
    Temperature varies roughly as the logarithm of pressure
    Altitude varies very roughly as the logarithm of pressure

Or another way of saying the same thing is that we assume mixing ratios and
temperature vary linearly with altitude, while pressure varies exponentially
with altitude.
