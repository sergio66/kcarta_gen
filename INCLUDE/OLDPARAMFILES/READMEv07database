Version 07 has updated HITRAN2004 parameters for a few of the gases, such as
water vapor and HNO3. In addition, we release the CO2 385ppmv database, and 
corresponding layer profiles for use with this version.

We suggest that CKDv6 is used by the user. This uses the default water 
continuum coefficients from MT-CKD1, and adds on the tuning done 
by Scott Hannon, where he compares kCARTA/SARTA calculations with 7+ years
of AIRS observations.
