v1.07
-----
This is the version that will be used with our new kCompressed Database.
We will allow "two new" gases in with this, the self part and the foreign part 
of the water continuum. The profiles for these will obviously be the same
as that of water vapor. Temperature and "amount" Jacobians will be computed
for these gases, which will have gasIDs 101 and 102. The CKD data is in 
binary files, and so kcarta.param needs the user to set the path to these
binary files.

One can only use the self and foreign continuums if water is one of the
gases in the profile, and if kCKD >= 0 (ie water continuum is turned on).
If one only wants to see the continuum (eg dump out path spectra of
self continuum only), one can easily tailor the driver namelist file to
do this eg set water (gasID = 1) weight to 0.0

1/16/02         Fixed bug in VACONV; angles were not changing correctly
                with altitude.  NOTE: Sergio is no longer maintaining
                V1.07, so the fix has been applied to *this* particular
                SRCV1.07 only.  The fix has been applied to the current
                version, V1.10.

7/12/00         Fixed a bug in one of the arrays (iagases was specified with 
                size kMaxGas in some routines, kGasStore in others; it has now 
                been set to kMaxGas in all routines)

7/4/00          Modified the scatter input routine (in n_rad_jac_scat.f) to
                allow user to use same scattering table for different layers 
                of atmosphere. This might be hazardous, as cloud temperatures 
                used in the Mie scattering routines might not be consistent 
                with some of the atmosphere layers used by kCARTA. However, 
                this will easily allow one scattering table to be used with a
                multilayer cloud

7/2/00          Fixed bug in upward looking radiance; raInten was NOT being 
                set, and so if doJacobOutput = 1, would give bizzare answers
                Note these changes have NOT been tested for sun in FOV 

7/2/00          Fixed bug in doJacobOutput for uplook instr .... had to 
                correctly set variable iLower in main part of jac_up.f 

7/2/00          Fixed bug in jac_up; if kJacobOuput=1, it was not 
                computing d(BT)/drad

6/13/00         Cleaned up a bug in reading scatter namelist section

6/13/00         Cleaned up a bug in setting scatter layer temperatures

v1.06
-----
Major change is to use namelists instead of kcarta driver files
To maintain backwards compatibility with previous versions, all the s_* files
that were previously used to parse in the driver input files, are now grouped
separately in directory NAMELIST. When the code is compiled and linked, it 
produes an executable that can parse in the old input driver files, and
write out a namelist file that kcartav1.06+ can use

Note that this namelist producer still does quite a bit of error checking, 
as is the case for the old s_*.f files; however, not all error checking is
done thoroughly eg in output section, there is no error checking done.

The new namelist reader files do the same amount of error checking as did the
s_*.f files

Note that ReadNewData will NOT add on water continuum if asked for ie it  
assumes that the externally supplied water spectra is just the pure lineshape 
(lorentz/voigt/local) PLUS the necessary continuum 

7/12/00         Fixed a bug in one of the arrays (iagases was specified with 
                size kMaxGas in some routines, kGasStore in others; it has now 
                been set to kMaxGas in all routines)

7/2/00          Fixed bug in upward looking radiance; raInten was NOT being 
                set, and so if doJacobOutput = 1, would give bizzare answers

7/2/00          Fixed bug in doJacobOutput for uplook instr .... had to 
                correctly set variable iLower in main part of jac_up.f 

7/2/00          Fixed bug in jac_up; if kJacobOuput=1, it was not 
                computing d(BT)/drad
 
4/18/00         When reading in radiance section, kCARTA checks to see if
                surface temperatures are ridiculous! Or if emissivities are < 0

4/4/00          "pprof" in PrepareOutput (file s_writefile.f) was mistakenly
                outputting kProfLayer+1 values, instead of kProfLayer values
                This has now been fixed, ; also affects readkcarta.f/m and 
                readkcstd.m

3/23/00         Parameter KXsecFormat tells code whether or not to
                use kCompressed files (+1) or the Xsec binary file (-1)
                for the minor cross section gases (gasID 51-63)

3/15/00         Sent files through g77, Absoft77 to clear little errors
                g77 does not seem to be too happy with namelists in that it
                wants different names for subroutine arguments, as compared
                to namelist symbols

3/14/00         File "DumbFile" is a temporary file that is created at runtime

v1.05
-----

Major changes are 
1) to treat the cross section gases the same way as the rest of the gases ie 
   use a compressed database for them as well
2) to use the water vapor continuum in the same fashion as that of the CKD
   model ie use kwater=(klorentz-basement) + CKD

3/1/00          Fixed subroutines calcon2.3,2.4 so that the self continuum
                contribution is smoothly interpolated across 10 cm-1 chunks

2/24/00         Fixed kcartamain.f so that kStdFlux is closed at end of run

2/24/00         Fixed routine in rad_scat.f so that raInten is not set to 0.0
                and thus driving part of the jacobian calculations nuts!

2/14/00         Making interface_rtspec more clear about upward/downward
                satellite, by being more careful about the sign of muobs

2/10/00         Instead of reading in a (large) text file that contains the
                scattering data from sscatmie.f, kCARTA can read in a 
                smaller binary file. This file is produced by running
                program "translate" found in the RTSPEC directory.
                This involves setting new parameter "binary" to +1 in
                the *SCATTR section

1/11/00         Rewriting kcoeffMAIN.f so that there no longer are 
                different calls for the cross section gases. This means calls 
                to routines calq,calxsc have been removed

11/3/99         Adding on CKDv2.4 .. parameter kCKD can now be -1,0,21,23,24
                Subroutine xspl() added to kcartamisc.f so that the coarse
                grid of S296,S260,F296 data can be immediately splined
                onto the finer kCARTA grid. 

                However, note that this feature cannot be used in SRCv1.04, 
                as the water lineshape in the database was not computed using 
                the local definition ie can only use CKDv0,21 or 23 in 
                kCARTAv1.04-

                There is no need to use h2o*_wb.f to complement fixing the 
                CKD2.3 code, as kCARTA database was computed using Lorentz 
                lineshape instead of local lineshape (=lorentz-basement).
                Thus all we have to do is to use the continuum code from
                GENLN2, with the modified h2o*.f data blocks (which add on
                the basement term).

v1.04
-----

The radiative transfer routines can now do one of the following three :  
  1) radiance, flux and jacobian computations for a clear sky
  2) read in external spectra for a gas; do radiance, flux computations
  3) radiance computations for a scattering atmosphere for a downlooking
     instrument. Solar contribution not included. Backgnd thermal not
     included. Only the radiance at TOA can be output.

11/19/99        Fixing bugs in the interface to rtspec.f
                Also adding on some subroutines so that clear sky radiative
                  transfer routines of rtspec.f, though slightly different, 
                  give answers that are within 0.05K of kCARTA answers ... 
                  this is especially important wrt background thermal.
                Note that if instrument is low in atmosphere, the scattering
                  code does not accurately add on TOA-instrument 
                  radiance -- as long as instrument is higher than the 
                  boundary found in function FindBoundary(raWaves), this 
                  will give < 0.05 K error, else error could creep upwards 
                  as arccos(3/5) is used instead of more accurate 
                  diffusive angle
                Remember that rtspec cannot include solar contribution
 
10/28/99        Fixed two bugs in CKDv2.3, after looking at LBLRTMv50.1
                and v5.10

9/28/99         Include solar spectrum into radiance computations. 
                This means that *RADNCE options changed slightly --- now 
                for a downward looking instrument, parameter iSolar means :
                    -1 => no solar
                     0 => use solar, at T=5600K
                     1 => use solar, with more detailed spectrum

                For an upward looking instrument, Tspace now has 2 options
                   T > 0 use temperature as specified
                   T < 0 use sun in FOV, with spectrum obtained from 
                     datafiles
                  Thus eg T = 2.96   ==> no sun in FOV
                          T = 5600   ==> compute solar spectrum using 5600K
                          T = -1     ==> use solar data files

                Path to the data files for solar spectra are given by
                parameter kSolarPath in file kcarta.param

9/9/99          Changed *SPECTR so that new spectroscopy for more than
                one gas can be read in per run. Also fixed it so that
                if any of the new gases is water vapor, you *can* add on the
                required water continuum using kCARTA

8/19/99         Fixed a bug in the parameters for one subroutines in 
                in file kcoeffSPLJAC.f (iDoDQ was an extra parameter in the
                subroutine definitions, and has been taken out)
                WaterAmountJAC (v1.04) === SplineWaterDerivativeSPL (v1.01)

8/19/99         Removed the "implicit none" definition in subroutine
                calcon23 in calcon.f and put it in the Makefile
 
8/17/99         Fixed a bug in the indexing of d(BT)/dq*q downlook jacobians
                This bug fix also is done in v1.01 

6/30/99         Fixed a bug in the diffusive approximation (backgnd thermal)
                computation --- there was a mixup between 100 and kProfLayer

6/17/99         Fixed a bug in satellite viewing angle conversion

5/25/99         Put in *SCATTR section into the file s_scatter_spectra.f
                Also have new parameter kMaxClouds in kcarta.param

5/20/99         Interfacing K.F.Evans rtspec.f code with kCARTA
                    Frank Evans  University of Colorado   September 1998
                    Co-authors:
                      Merritt Deeter  (single scattering layer routines)
                      Aaron Evans     (multilayer code, spectral segments)  
                scatter.param sets array dimensions in rtspec.f to be the 
                same as those in kcarta.param

5/19/99         Put in *SPECTR section into file s_scatter_spectra.f
                This section allows the user to choose ONE gas, and have 
                kCARTA read in LBL spectra produced by some other code
                for defined spectral regions. These regions have to overlap 
                the kCARTA chunks eg 705-730, 1255-1280 etc
                If this option is used, then JACOBN cannot be used!!
                Also, the code will simply read in the spectra, and weight 
                it appropriately ... it will not do any further scaling. In
                other words, it is the users responsibility to make sure the
                spectra read in were computed with the correct layer amounts
                and temperatures.

5/4/99          Bug in SetEmissivity in rad_misc.f has been fixed

5/3/99          The gauss-legendre weights for accurate background thermal
                and flux computations, have been moved to gauss.param

4/30/99         Parameter kProfile is no longer in use
                It is replaced by parameter kFlux : 
                -1 : default (no flux computations)
                +1 : the radiance flux for each layer in current atmosphere
                     is computed, as fcn of wavenumber.
                     Results are in units of radiances
                +2 : the radiance flux for each layer in current atmosphere
                     is computed, as fcn of wavenumber. These fluxes are 
                     then appropriately multiplied to change units to 
                     kelvins s-1 (mult=1/(Cp density dz)). 
                If results are dumped to screen (using the command line 
                arguments), the flux computations are output in file 
                flux.dat. Else they are saved to radfilename_FLUX
                   kcarta.x driverfile ==> 
                      rad results, jacob results to screen; 
                      flux results to flux.dat
                   kcarta.x driverfile radfilename jacobfile ==> 
                       rad results to radfilename
                       jacob results to jacobfile
                       flux results to radfile_FLUX
                Reader readflux.f in UTILITY, or readflux.m in MATLAB, can
                be used to read in the flux files

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

v1.03
-----

this allows the user to have more or less than 100 layers!!!!!!!!
in other words, can subdivide bottom AIRS layers, and thicken top AIRS
layers. Use with profiles made by KLAYERS/LookUp1.03
The prototype for this code is kCARTAv1.02 and KLAYERS/UpLook1.02

**** This version is a significant rewrite/ rearrangement of the code ****

4/23/99         If the CKD abs coefficients are computed, and found to be
                slightly less than 0 (k <= - 1e7), then they are set to 0, 
                and the code keeps on running with a warning.
                If they are large and negative, then the code halts.
                Ditto for the cross section gases.
                Similarly, the code stops if it finds negative temperatures,
                gas amounts, pressures or partial pressures in either the
                reference profiles or actula profile.

4/20/99         Boundary conditions in *RADNCE no longer affect the mixing 
                table. This means that the same *WEIGHTS set can be used 
                for different atmospheres. This has led to a rewrite of
                the radioance and jacobian routines.

4/19/99         renamed and/or rearranged many of the strings*.f files
                as well as the radiance and jacobian files

4/14/99         Found a bug in radiance for uppermost fractional layer
                in downward looking instrument, in subroutine 
                RadianceInterpolate. Cleaned up/ rewrote the radiance 
                interpolation subroutines for up and down look instruments.

4/14/99         Found a bug in backgndthermal ... if you set kBackThermal=0,
                kCARTA always used acos(3/5) in upper layers and more 
                accurate angle in lower layers, even if you asked it to 
                use rAngle

4/8/99          PrepareOutput also dumps out pressure levels and parameters 
                M1000mb,M100mb,MSubLayer,M50mb,M10mb,MThickLayer
                So a "enhanced" readmainheader.m, .f  set of readers needed

4/6/99          New parameter in kcarta.param allows user to put in a 
                profile that has more or less than 100 AIRS layers!!!!!!
                This is parameter kProfLayer <=> kMaxLayer
                The program splines in temperature AND pressure!!!! onto 
                this finer and not so finer layering grid

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

v1.02
-----

this allows the user to have more than 100 layers!!!!!!!!
in other words, can subdivide bottom AIRS layers to make them finer.
Use with profiles made by KLAYERS/UpLookSrc1.02

3/30/99         Fixed a bug in *WEIGHTS. This means couple of relevant  
                subroutines in strings3.f have been updated

3/10/99         New parameter in kcarta.param allows user to put in a 
                profile that has more than 100 AIRS layers!!!!!!
                This is parameter kProfLayer >= kMaxLayer
                The program splines in temperature AND pressure!!!! onto 
                this finer layering grid
                The porogram also needs the new pressure levels grid!!!!!

                Also variable kMaxLayerJac has been renamed to kProfLayerJac

3/14/99         Variable kNewRefProf is a text string that says where to
                find the new reference profiles

                rdprof.f has been renamed strings4.f

2/17/99         kcoeffSPL.f split into two files : 
                kcoeffSPL and kcoeffSPLJAC.f where all non Jacobian code is
                in the first file
                SplineWaterDerivativeSPL  renamed to WaterAmountInterpolate
                WaterAmountInterpolateSPL renamed to WaterAmount_TempJAC

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

v1.01
-----

COMMENT : changes made to allow user to redefine his surface temperature. 
This has meant that parameter 7 (that was UNUSED in v1.00) has been renamed 
from kCO2 to kSurfTemp, and now has 2 different meanings : -1 use the 
specified surface temperature, and +1 use an interpolated temperature 
PLUS an offset that is set by the surface temperature

11/20/98   	The meaning of parameter 7 (kSurfTemp in *PARAMS) is now
                -1.0 : use surface temperature set by user in *RADNCE
                +1.0 : use surface temperature interpolated by pressure 
                       levels and added to offset set by user in *RADNCE
                       Note that the interpolation is smooth in AVERAGE
                       pressure, and not in actual pressure

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

v1.00
-----

COMMENT : minor changes to ensure the *OUTPUT section has first paths,
then mixed paths then radiances specified (ie order is important).
Also, the short form INPUT profile is no longer allowed ie kProfile=+1
only. This is because we need correct partial pressures when computing
the variable water widths. This also makes the use of parameter 7
irrelevant, and the value is now fixed at 1.0

10/21/98        Corrected vaconv (satellite local angle computation)
                in that everything now is consistently in km : kLayers
                profile, sat height in *RADNCE etc
8/26/98         The user has to be careful in specifying the order of
                output data in *OUTPUT (so that the readers are not
                confused)
8/26/98         The meaning of parameter 6 (kProfile in *PARAMS) is now
                -1 : read in specified KLAYERS user profile ONLY
10/5/98   	The meaning of parameter 7 (kCO2 in *PARAMS) is now
                1.0 : the multiplier for CO2

&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&


v0.99

COMMENT : revision to change the meaning of parameter 6 in *PARAMS. This 
meant quite a few changes in strings2.f, as the previous subroutines were 
geared to expect only water and ozone ........

7/7/98          The meaning of parameter 6 (kProfile in *PARAMS) is now
                -1 : read in user supplied profile. For whatever gas 
                    specified in MOLGAS/XSCGAS but not found in the 
                    profile, just read  in the reference profile
                    If the user specifies a profile file to be read in,
                    the temperatures of the extra gases (read in from the
                    reference profiles) are that of water or the first   
                    gas found in the user supplied profile.
                +1 : read in specified regression profile

COMMENT : revisions mainly to add CKDv2.3
          have option 8 in *PARAMS to set d/Dt=Planck or tau or both
          also rewrote the output stuff slightly 

5/14/98         Rewrote wrtout, wrtout_head so that the program only opens
		and closes the output and jacobian binary files once
		This was to keep the poor Absoft compiler happy (pshaw!)

5/13/98		Rewrote temperature Jacobians so that option 8 in *PARAMS
                sets d/Dt=Planck or tau or both (-2,-1,0); default=0
                Note that if you choose kTempJac other than 0, than your
                gas jacobians should not become become messed up.
                Also this option only works for down look instr (ie has no
                effect on jacobians for uplook instr)

5/13/98		fixed a bug in *JACOBN reader that did not allow this
                section to be parsed in if STATIC turned off

4/29/98		Rewrote some subroutines in strings2.f so that if 
		kProfile = 1, the program does NOT need MOLGAS to have
                water and or ozone

COMMENT : revisions are mainly to increase wavenumber spread from
605-2805, to 205-605,605-2805. These two regions are kept separate
since the wavenumber point spacing in them will be unequal (0.001 in
205-605, and 0.0025 in 605-2805). However, the number of points in each
k-comp file is kept at 10000 (hence 10 cm-1 in the first region, and 25
cm-1 in the second region).

This means a lot of the core subroutines (eg GetFileFreqs in misc.f was
rewritten),  as was the main loop structure in kcartamain.f. We also 
rewrote subroutine wrtout, so a new set of readers is needed.

kOutBlock has been removed !!!!!!!
in other words, can only dump out 10000 pts each time!!!!
iFrlow,iFrHigh=1,kMaxPts

*XSCGAS has been changed so that the name of xscdata file is no longer 
in this section; instead it has been moved to kcarta.param

kNetCDF has been removed. the code can only output binary Fortran files.
We will probably write a fortran --> NetCDF translator in the future

kCARTA is now command line driven 
  kcarta.x [infile [outfile [jacfile]]]
thus *OUTPUT no longer has caOutName
and caJacobName is no longer caOutName + 'JAC'
errors are written to stderr
warning meassages are written to kWarnFile == 'warning.msg' or '/dev/null'
header.head no longer exists; it is part of warning.msg

5/13/98		fixed a bug in *JACOBN reader that did not allow this
                section to be parsed in if STATIC turned off

4/29/98         Fixed a bug in the d/dT temperature Jacobian (jacob.f) 

4/27/98		Main loop slightly rewritten so that subroutine Initialize
		only called if the abs copeffs DNE for the particular
                10000 pt chunk. In addition the call to set iaPaths has
                been moved so that this loop called IFF we want paths to
                be output

4/27/98         Fixed CrossSection() in kcoeffMAIN.f so that we don't have
                to worry about initialized stuff in kcartamain.f

4/27/98		Fixed writesummary.m in ../MATLAB
