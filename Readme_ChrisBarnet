Sergio,

You would have to have a conversation with Antonia about the
Pgood/Pbest thing -- but I will see if I can dig it out of my stuff
over the next couple of days.  I never use that because I find it
absurd to try to use a partial profile.  We constrained TOA and if we
are influenced by clouds it has affected all layers of our product.

Attached is lsurface.f which you call as

  Nobs = 100
  Pobs() = the 100 LEVELS of SARTA
  Psurf = surface pressure
  Plow = 100.0
  Phgh = 1100.0

numlev  = lsurface(Nobs, Pobs, Psurf, Plow, Phgh)

Then we get the layer temperature as follows:

  Tlevel(L) = temperature at Pobs(L), L=1,100
  (I usually make T(numlev+1,100) = T(numlev)
  call meantemp(numlev, Pobs, Psurf, Tlevel, Tlayer)
  Tlayer(L) = mean temperature for SARTA call

The bottom layer of layer column density (molecules/cm^2/layer) for
all constituent's must be multiplied by when doing validation but in
our call's to SARTA it is done internally, so we compute optical depth
of full layers and then use BLMULT prior to computing transmittance.

So when looking at constituent profiles you compute BLMULT as
 BLMULT = (Psurfret-Pobs(numlev-1))/
           (Pobs(numlev)-Pobs(numlev-1))

By the way, CO2 is in ppmv and is NOT adjusted at surface since it is
a ratio of two layer column densities.  But CO, CH4, etc. requires
this correction.
