User Interface 
---------------

rtpread.m, rtpwrite.m     -- read and write HDF4 RTP data as a
                             structure of arrays

rtpread2.m, rtpwrite2.m   -- read and write HDF4 RTP data as an
                             array of structures

sdload.m, sdsave.m        -- read and write HDF4 SD's and NetCDF
                             files as a structure of arrays

h4sdread.m, h4sdwrite.m   -- read and write HDF4 SD's and NetCDF
                             files as a cell list of arrays

h4vsread.m, h4vswrite.m   -- read and write HDF4 vdatas as a
                             structure of arrays

h4sgread.m, h4sgwrite.m   -- read and write HDF4 vgroups of SD's as
                             an array of structures

gpro2rtp.m, rtp2gpro.m    -- translate between RTP and GENLN2 format
                             profiles

Demos and Tests
----------------

rtptest4.m, rtptest5.m    -- basic demos of rtpread and rtpwrite

srfdemo.m                 -- how to use h4vsread.m and h4vswrite.m 
                             to read and write AIRS SRFs

sdtest1.m                 -- tests h4sgread.m and h4sgwrite.m 
sdtest2.m                 -- tests mat2sdsid.m and sdsid2mat.m
sdtest3.m                 -- tests h4sdread.m and h4sdwrite.m
vstest1.m                 -- tests mat2vsfid.m and vsfid2mat.m
vstest2.m                 -- tests h4vsread.m and h4vswrite.m


Selected Utilities
-------------------

sructcmp.m                -- compare structures, allowing for different 
                             field sets and values within some tolerance

stransp1.m, stransp2.m    -- translate between structure of arrays and
                             an array of structures

gproread.m, gprowrite.m   -- read and write GENLN2 format user profiles

mat2vsfid.m, vsfid2mat.m  -- write and read a matlab structure array
                             as an HDF4 vdata, to an open HDF4 file ID

mat2sdsid.m, sdsid2mat.m  -- write and read a matlab array as an HDF4
                             SDS, to an open HDF4 SD ID


Miscellaneous Notes
--------------------

The user interface and utilities include Matlab-style documentation
at the beginning of the files.

h4sdread.m can read ARM/CART data, which is written in netCDF but
can be read as HDF SD's, and h4vsread.m can read Jiang Zhao's RAOB
vdata format.  (For that matter, h4vsread.m can read RTP data, too,
but it leaves everything as int32's and singles, which Matlab does
not like.)


Matlab Compatibility 
---------------------

The SD interface attribute write doesn't work for Matlab 5.3/R11;
this is fixed in the 6.0/R12 release
