CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.1 TO VERSION 2.2
---------------------------------------

Added sdload.m and sdsave.m; these are basically just more user
friendly versions of h4sdread.m and h4sdwrite.m

mat2sdsid.m and sdsid2mat.m now treat dimension names properly


CHANGES FROM VERSION 1 to VERSION 2
------------------------------------

The new RTP reader and writer, rtpread.m and rtpwrite.m, are now
the simpler versions that read and write HDF4 RTP data as a structure
of arrays, while the new rtpread2.m and rtpwrite2.m read and write
HDF4 RTP data as a array of structures.

The new rtpread2.m and rtpwrite2.m should work as exact replacements
for the old rtpread.m and rtpwrite.m.

The new rtpread.m and rtpwrite.m are faster because they do not
transpose the data from a structure of arrays to an array of
structures, they do not create the pseudo-field "gamnt", and they
do not do as much checking of the data, particularly for writes.

The name of the user interface readers and writers have been
changed, as follows:

     Version 1 names             Version 2 names

  mat2h4vs.m, h4vs2mat.m     h4vswrite.m, h4vsread.m   
  mat2h4sd.m, h4sd2mat.m     h4sdwrite.m, h4sdread.m
  mat2h4sg.m, h4sg2mat.m     h4sgwrite.m, h4sgread.m

For performance reasons, the vdata routines rtpread.m, rtpwrite.m,
h4vsread.m, and h4vswrite.m were changed to read or write a structure
of arrays, rather than an array of structures.  The new procedures
rtpread2.m and rtpwrite2.m read and write an array of structures,
and are a direct replacement for the V1 rtpread.m and rtpwrite.m
